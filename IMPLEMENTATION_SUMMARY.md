# TripGenie Monorepo Implementation Summary

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. Monorepo Structure
- ✅ Created pnpm workspace configuration
- ✅ Organized code into `apps/api` and `apps/web` directories
- ✅ Set up `infrastructure` directory for Docker configurations
- ✅ Created root package.json with workspace scripts

### 2. Docker Configuration
- ✅ Created multi-stage Dockerfile for API with Prisma migrations
- ✅ Created optimized Dockerfile for Next.js with standalone build
- ✅ Set up docker-compose.yml with all required services:
  - PostgreSQL 16 with health checks
  - Redis 7 with persistence
  - Mailhog for email testing
  - API service with auto-migration
  - Web service with SSR support

### 3. Environment Configuration
- ✅ Created `.env.docker` files for both API and Web
- ✅ Set up dual base URLs for frontend (client vs server)
- ✅ Configured proper environment variables for Docker networking

### 4. Integration Fixes
- ✅ Fixed CORS configuration to allow credentials and expose headers
- ✅ Updated frontend API client to use dual base URLs
- ✅ Fixed Next.js route handlers to use internal API URLs in Docker
- ✅ Added health check endpoints for all services

### 5. Developer Experience
- ✅ Created Makefile with common commands
- ✅ Added setup.sh script for one-command initialization
- ✅ Created test-setup.sh for verifying the stack
- ✅ Added comprehensive README with Ubuntu instructions

### 6. Code Quality
- ✅ Added .editorconfig for consistent formatting
- ✅ Created .dockerignore files to optimize builds
- ✅ Set up proper .gitignore for monorepo

## 🔧 Key Features Implemented

### Authentication & Authorization
- Magic link authentication with email
- JWT tokens with refresh mechanism
- httpOnly cookies for security
- Free vs Premium tier distinction

### API Features
- OpenAPI documentation at `/docs`
- Health checks and readiness probes
- Prometheus metrics endpoint
- Rate limiting and security headers

### Frontend Features
- Server-side rendering with Next.js 14
- Dual API URL configuration (SSR vs client)
- Model override header for investor demo
- Responsive UI with Tailwind CSS

### Infrastructure
- Docker Compose orchestration
- Named volumes for data persistence
- Health checks for all services
- Service dependencies properly configured

## 📝 Usage Instructions

### Quick Start
```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone <repo>
cd tripgenie
./infrastructure/bin/setup.sh

# Update API keys in apps/api/.env.docker
# - OPENAI_API_KEY (required)
# - STRIPE_SECRET_KEY (optional)

# Start everything
make up
```

### Access Points
- Web: http://localhost:3000
- API: http://localhost:8080
- Docs: http://localhost:8080/docs
- Email: http://localhost:8025

### Development Commands
```bash
make up       # Start all services
make down     # Stop and clean
make logs     # View logs
make dev      # Local development mode
```

## 🎯 Free vs Premium Model Binding

The system implements the required model binding:
- **Free tier**: Uses GPT-3.5-turbo (configured as OPENAI_MODEL_LIGHT)
- **Premium tier**: Uses GPT-4 (configured as OPENAI_MODEL)
- **Investor override**: Can be toggled via x-model-override header

## 🔒 Security Considerations

- All secrets use placeholder values in `.env.docker`
- JWT secrets should be replaced in production
- CORS configured for specific origins
- Rate limiting enabled on API
- SQL injection prevention via Prisma ORM

## 🚀 Production Readiness

To deploy to production:
1. Replace all placeholder secrets
2. Configure proper domain and SSL
3. Use external PostgreSQL and Redis
4. Set NODE_ENV=production
5. Configure proper backup strategy
6. Set up monitoring and alerting

## 📊 Testing

The implementation includes:
- Health check endpoints for monitoring
- Test setup script for verification
- Mailhog for email testing
- Stripe test mode for payments

## 🎉 Success Criteria Met

✅ Single `docker compose up --build` command starts everything
✅ Free and Premium flows work end-to-end
✅ CORS and authentication properly configured
✅ Model binding works as specified
✅ All services health-checked and monitored
✅ Clean monorepo structure with pnpm workspaces
✅ Comprehensive documentation provided

The TripGenie platform is now fully dockerized and ready for deployment!
